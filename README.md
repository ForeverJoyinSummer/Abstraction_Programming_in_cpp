# Abstraction_Programming_in_cpp
These assignments are adapted by cs106b in Stanford(2022 summer)

## Assignment 1
The goal of this assignment is to practise some basic grammar of cpp. We need to implement a perfect number searching program and a soundex searching program in this assignment.

## Assignment 2
We need to understand the concept of abstraction through this assignment. Besides, some classic data structures(Vectors, Grid, Stack, Queue, Set, Map) are used to solve the maze problem by the classic BFS algorithm. At the end of the assignemnt, we are going to implement a simple search engine with the help of CS106B!

## Assignment 3
We are going to use a recursive method to solve small problems such as: parenthesis matching, sierpinksi triangles and list merging(merge sort).These small exercises can be found in some popular coding websites(Leetcode etc.)

## Assignment 4
The goal of this assignment is to take a deeper understanding of recursive methods. It is harder than the previous assignemnt because we need to divide the origin problems into several sub-problems and different base cases. We need to understand an efficient program model named backtrack, then we are going to implement a boggle game and a voting system by backtracking(DFS).

## Assignment 5
Use the pointer to create and implement a linked list by ourselves! We need to escape from the maze which is created by your own name.

## Assignment 6
Implement a priority queue data structure by array and binary heap, and we can have a simple understanding and application of the classic top-K algorithm in this assignment.
