# Abstraction_Programming_in_cpp
These assignments are adapted by cs106b in Stanford(2022 summer)

## Assignment 1
The goal of this assignment is to practise some basic grammar of cpp. We need to implement a perfect number searching program and a soundex searching program in this assignment.

## Assignment 2
We need to understand the concept of abstraction through this assignment. Besides, some classic data structures(Vectors, Grid, Stack, Queue, Set, Map) are used to solve the maze problem by the classic BFS algorithm. At the end of the assignemnt, we are going to implement a simple search engine with the help of CS106B!

## Assignment 3
